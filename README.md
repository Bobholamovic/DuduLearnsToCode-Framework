# The Unnamed

**Note: DuduLearnsToCode is not the official name of this project, but a placeholder until I come up with a good name.**

A simple template for deep learning projects with PyTorch.

## Visions

+ Code more as a developer, or configure more as a researcher.
+ More free than a framework; more maintainable than a template.
+ Lightweight and fast.
